# Steady-state-2D-Heat-conduction
The Boundary conditions for the problem are as follows;\

Top Boundary = 600 K\
Bottom Boundary = 900 K\
Left Boundary = 400 K\
Right Boundary = 800 K\

I used three methods for solving it implicitly/
1. Jacobi/
2. Gauss-seidel/
3. Successive over-relaxation/

Result by Jacobi/
