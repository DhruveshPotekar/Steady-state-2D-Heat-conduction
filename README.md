# Steady-state-2D-Heat-conduction
The Boundary conditions for the problem are as follows;

Top Boundary = 600 K\
Bottom Boundary = 900 K\
Left Boundary = 400 K\
Right Boundary = 800 K

I used three methods for solving it implicitly\
1. Jacobi\
2. Gauss-seidel\
3. Successive over-relaxation\

Result by Jacobi\
